ABSTRACT

In the today world customer satisfaction is the key to success for any business. In a restaurant, the traditional
hand-waving method for calling services is inefficient often leading to many complaints and similarly keeping track 
of the restaurant customers billed items and, inventory management for the business would be a tedious job if we use 
the traditional method of tracking it using paper works. The proposed Restaurant Management System increases operational
efficiency through use of a statistical data processing unit. 

The model has been divided in to 3 major features. 
Firstly, it handles front office and patron management to incorporate booking reservation tables for customers, 
ordering food and patrons paying the food bills. 
Secondly, inventory management system which keeps tracks of food 
product items. 
Thirdly, our software model maintains the vendor list and it also employee management, which keeps
track of total number of hours worked by an employee and their hourly rate. A data processing unit allows managers 
and owners to easily monitor restaurant functions and employee progress.
